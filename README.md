### Bank Customer Analysis
#### Problem Statement
The bank faces a high customer churn rate but lacks clarity on the causes. This analysis aims to uncover patterns in customer demographics, financial profiles, and engagement behaviors to identify key drivers and provide insights for improving retention strategies
#### Analysis
##### Geographical Distribution
France had the highest number of customers (about 50%)
Germany and Spain had a smaller share
##### Credit Score Trends
Most customers have credit scores between 650–700
Only a few customers fall in the Excellent range (781–850)
France has the highest number of customers across all credit score categories
##### Gender-Based Insights
Males have slightly higher credit scores and estimated salaries compared to females
The proportion of high-balance and zero-balance customers is also slightly higher among males
##### Balance Distribution
48% of customers are high-balance individuals, with average balances between 80,000–150,000
36% of customers have zero balances
Zero-balance customers are mostly found in France, while Germany has none
Germany has the highest number of high-balance customers, and Spain the least.
##### Tenure & Financial Behavior
Customers with 1-year tenure have the highest average balance, followed by a decline and gradual rise until year 10.
Tenure does not show a strong correlation with balance, product ownership, or credit score.
Tenure 1 customers own the most products, credit cards, and show the highest activity.
##### Customer Type
The proportion of premium customers is low across all regions.
#### Key Insights
Credit score and balance are not strongly dependent on tenure.

Male customers slightly outperform females in salary and financial metrics.

France dominates in customer volume, but also holds the highest share of zero-balance individuals.

Germany appears to host the most financially healthy customers, especially high-balance individuals.

A large segment of customers maintain high balances, suggesting potential for cross-sell opportunities.

#### Recommendations
Target high-balance customers in Germany for premium services and investment products.

Develop strategies to engage zero-balance customers in France, possibly through onboarding financial products or improving credit accessibility.

Promote financial products more actively to shorter-tenure customers, who show higher activity and product ownership.

Consider gender-tailored offerings, as financial behavior slightly varies between male and female customers.

Re-evaluate premium customer criteria or promotion strategy due to the consistently low adoption across regions.

#### Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior across geography, gender, tenure, and financial metrics. The findings highlight key areas for strategic focus, especially in terms of customer targeting and engagement. By leveraging these insights, financial institutions can better align their services with customer needs and drive growth through smarter segmentation.
